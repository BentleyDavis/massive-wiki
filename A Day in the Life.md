# A Day in the Life

It's possible to use many different tools and practices with Massive Wiki, which is one of its strengths.

However, as sort of a "best practices" overview, here are tools and practices many of us use day-to-day with our Massive Wikis.

- Have more than one Massive Wiki, for different topics, or to collaborate with different groups of people, or to keep some information private and make other information public.
- Use Obsidian and the Obsidian Git plugin. The Obsidian user community is great, as is Eleanor Konik's [Obsidian Roundup](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/tag/roundup/). (Pulsar Edit is a good choice, too.)
- Use HackMD or HedgeDoc to work synchronously with people. You can save notes as Markdown files, and add them straight to your wikis.
- Read some of the original wiki culture writeups. You can get a start here: [Link As You Think](https://developer.massive.wiki/wiki_theory_and_culture/link_as_you_think), which links to [The Brilliant Essence of Wikis](https://eekim.com/2005/09/the-brilliant-essence-of-wikis/) by Eugene Eric Kim, and to [WikiNow](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/WikiNow) on MeatballWiki. Ward's original wiki is great, too: <https://wiki.c2.com/>.
