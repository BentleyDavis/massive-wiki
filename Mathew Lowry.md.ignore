# Mathew Lowry

By day I work as an information architect and strategist in the interrelated areas of communications, community, collaboration, innovation and knowledge management for the EU Institutions in Brussels, where I am apparently one of the very few Australian theoretical-physicists-turned-science-journalists anyone here has ever met. I've been on the internet since the late 1980s so I've got [a few firsts under my belt](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/about/#me), and tend to be called in to solve the wickeder type of problem.

In my spare time I'm trying to figure out how to kickstart decentralised collective intelligence. That probably explains why I launched [myhub.ai](https://myhub.ai/), conceived and co-edit the [ToolsforThought Map massive.wiki pilot](https://tftmap.massive.wiki/) with [[Peter Kaminski]] and [[Bill Anderson]], and see both as building blocks of [A Minimum Viable Ecosystem for collective intelligence](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4).

I'm married with two great kids and [a dog](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23peluchefatale&src=typed_query&f=live), who is the only member of the family I share online.

I love connecting people with other people and having good conversations, so don't hesitate to get in touch. More on what I Like, Think and Do, plus contact/follow/subscribe, on [my personal Hub](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/).
