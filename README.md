# MaSVF Wiki

This is MaSVF Wiki.

MaSVF is short for "Markdown and Shared Versioned Files". It is pronounced somewhere between "massive" and "massif".

By convention, the home page in MaSVF wikis is README.

## Editing MaSVF Wiki

This part is clunky, because the MaSVF ecosystem hasn't optimized it yet.

Making this part better is a key goal for MaSVF.

But if you're feeling adventurous, jump on in!  If need be, get a friend who already knows Markdown or git to help you.  And remember, it will get a lot easier as the MaSVF movement unfolds.

### GitHub and MaSVF Wiki repo membership

Since MaSVF Wiki's primary repo is hosted on GitHub, you need to be a member of GitHub to edit (or propose edits) in that repo.

Any GitHub member can "fork" the repo (make a copy of the repo into their account), make edits, and then make a pull request for the primary repo maintainers to consider.

Alternatively, you can ask to be a member of the repo, and then you will have privileges to make edits directly in the repo.  Contact [Peter Kaminski](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) to ask to be a member of the MaSVR repo.

Being a member of the repo will make editing easier.

### Using GitHub, as a member of the MaSVF Wiki repo

Go to the [MaSVF Wiki repo on GitHub](https://github.com/peterkaminski/masvf-wiki).

Navigate to the file (page) you want to edit.

Click on the pencil icon at the upper right of the file's content.

Edit and preview changes until you're happy with your changes.

Scroll down to "Commit changes".  In the one-line-high text box, type a short description of your changes.  Leave "Commit directly to the `main` branch" selected (unless you want to commit to a different branch), then click the green "Commit changes" button.

### Using GitHub, as a non-member of the MaSVF Wiki repo

Go to the [MaSVF Wiki repo on GitHub](https://github.com/peterkaminski/masvf-wiki).

In the upper right corner, click the "Fork" button. This will make a copy of the repo in your account.

Make changes as described in the section above.  You can change more than one file.

Return to the main page of your copy of the repo.

Above the list of files, look for the box that says something similar to, "This branch is 1 commit ahead of...." To the right, there should be a "Pull request" link.  Click that, and follow the instructions to create and submit a pull request.

The maintainers of the primary repo will receive your pull request and act on it, by deciding to accept it, reject it, or ask for changes.

### Using Git, as a member of the MaSVF Wiki repo

This section assumes you are familiar with Git and how to use it.  Future versions of MaSVF documentation may provide much more detail about Git.

Go to the [MaSVF Wiki repo on GitHub](https://github.com/peterkaminski/masvf-wiki).

Click the green `Code` button and choose a download method: Clone or Open with GitHub Desktop.

When you have cloned the repo, edit the files you wish to change with your favorite Markdown or text editor.

Stage the files with "add".

Commit the files with "commit".  Include a commit message.

Upload the changes to the repo with "push".

### Using Git, as a non-member of the MaSVF Wiki repo

Follow the instructions in the "Using GitHub, as a non-member of the MaSVF Wiki repo" section above to fork the primary repo.

Follow the instructions in the "Using Git, as a member of the MaSVF Wiki repo" section above, but edit the files in your repo.

After you "add", "commit", and "push" the files, go to your GitHub repo and create and submit a pull request.
