# Massive Wiki

## Welcome to Massive Wiki

Massive Wiki is a movement to create a wiki *ecosystem* (rather than just one engine) that provides classic wiki utility, with a plurality of tools and processes that enable decentralization and federation of the pages.

Wikis are made of pages. Free the pages to go where they need to go!

It's not just a wiki - it's a Massive Wiki.
