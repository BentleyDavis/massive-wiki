# Massive Wiki

## Welcome to Massive Wiki

Massive Wiki is a movement to create not a wiki engine, but a wiki *ecosystem*, that provides classic wiki utility with a plurality of tools and processes that enable decentralization and federation of the pages.

Wikis are made of pages. Free the pages to go where they need to go!

It's not just a wiki - it's a Massive Wiki.
