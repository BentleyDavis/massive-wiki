# Massive Wiki Starter

[Massive Wiki Starter](https://github.com/Massive-Wiki/massive-wiki-starter) is used to start an empty wiki that's ready to be used with Obsidian, and published to Netlify via [[Massive Wiki Builder]]. Click the green "Use this template" button on the GitHub repo page to get started.

Support for publishing to GitHub Pages is being developed and will be merged into Massive Wiki Starter. For now, that work is in [Massive Wiki for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/peterkaminski/massive-wiki-for-github-actions)

If you don't need to publish your wiki to the web, you may not need Massive Wiki Starter.

If you have a Massive Wiki that wasn't started with Massive Wiki Starter, you can always create a new empty wiki from Massive Wiki Starter, then copy in all your Markdown files, and publish from the resulting wiki.
