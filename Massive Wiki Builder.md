# Massive Wiki Builder

You can use many applications to view and edit Massive Wikis.

One helpful tool, Massive Wiki Builder, converts a Massive Wiki into a static HTML website, for easy viewing on the web.  It is a "static site generator" for Massive Wikis.

You can see MWB on the [[Massive Wiki Conceptual Diagram]], in the center.

Massive Wiki Builder is used to recreate the main [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) website from its Markdown source files every time someone pushes changes to GitHub.

For more information, see the [Massive Wiki Builder](https://github.com/peterkaminski/massivewikibuilder/) repository on GitHub.
